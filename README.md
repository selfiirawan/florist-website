# 💐 Florist Website  

A simple **full-stack web application** built as part of my **12-day Web App Development Class**.  
This project is about building a florist website where users can browse products and submit a purchase order.  

## 📌 Features  
- 🛒 Users can fill out a purchase form to order flowers  
- 💾 Order details are stored in **MySQL database** via **PHP**  
- 📊 Orders can be viewed and managed in **phpMyAdmin** (through XAMPP)  
- 🎨 Frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- ⚙️ Backend handled with **PHP** and **XAMPP**  
- ❌ No online payment integration (order form only)
